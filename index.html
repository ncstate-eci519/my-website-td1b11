<div class="container">
<p class="orange" > I'm a former Physical Education and Health Teacher who switched careers to work in retail. 
I'm getting my master's degree to hopefully work in my company's corporate office some day.
I enjoy the following activities in no particular order:</p>

<div class="container">
<ul>
<li><strong>Traveling</strong>- We're hoping to go to Mexico next for my partners 40th birthday!</li>   
<li><strong>Sports</strong>- I used to play softball in college as well as MMA fighting.</li>
<li><strong>Red wine</strong>- I love going to wineries and hope I'll get to the Willamette Valley someday.</li>    
<li><strong>Hiking</strong>- There's a place in Charlotte called Crowder Mountain which is a great hike.</li>
<li><strong>My animals</strong>- I have three dogs and two cats. I enjoy adopting animals and giving them a loving home.</li>  
<li><strong>Working out</strong>- I own a Peloton and this was the best decision ever!</li>

		<h1>Favorite Ed Tech Tools</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2>Flip Grid</h2>
<p class="yellow" > This is one of two tools that I've become familiar with so far and I've only used it once so far though I anticpate using it much more often.
I enjoy the ability to record responses via video. This can be helpful when distance learning comes into play at my organization.</p>
  </li>
<li><h2>Camtasia</h2>
<p class="purple" > This was the first tool that I had the opportunity to use and I love that I can create how-to videos for my team.
I also appreciate the fact that you can capture video while performing actions on the computer.</p>
