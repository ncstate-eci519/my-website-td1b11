<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm a former Physcial Education and Health Teacher who switched careers to work in retail. 
I'm getting my master's degree to hopefully work in my company's corporate office some day.
I enjoy the following activities in no particular order:</p>
<b><ul>Traveling</b>- We're hoping to go to Mexico next for my partners 40th birthday!</ul>   
<b><ul>Sports</b>- I used to play softball in college as well as MMA fighting.</ul>
<b><ul>Red wine</b>- I love going to wineries and hope I'll get to the Willamette Valley someday.</ul>    
<b><ul>Hiking</b>- There's a place in Charlotte called Crowder Mountain which is a great hike.</ul>
<b><ul>My animals</b>- I have three dogs and two cats. I enjoy adopting animals and giving them a loving home.</ul>  
<b><ul>Working out</b>- I own a Peloton and this was the best decision ever!</ul>

<h1>Favorite Ed Tech Tools</h1>

<h2>Flip Grid</h2>
<p>This is one of two tools that I've become familiar with so far and I've only used it once so far though I anticpate using it much more often.
I enjoy the ability to record responses via video. This can be helpful when distance learning comes into play at my organization.</p>

<h2>Camtasia</h2>
<p>This was the first tool that I had the opportunity to use and I love that I can create how-to videos for my team.
I also appreciate the fact that you can capture video while performing actions on the computer.</p>
